# UFOs

## Overview

### Purpose
This project was conducted in order to make changes to a webpag dedicated to providing informaiton on UFO sightings. Changes were made to give the user an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings and allow th user to filter by multiple criteria such as date, city, country, and shape of the sighting. This makes use of a dynamic table and enhances the user's experience by permitting a refined search for specific UFO sightings. 

## Results

Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

The webpage begins with a brief introduction and description/discussion on UFOs and includes an invitation to "dig through the data" and utilize the search below to find more information on UFO sightings. The user can clear and refresh the search by clicking "UFO Sightings" in the top left corner of the page.

Below, on the lower left hand side is the search input field complete with a criteria such as date, city, state, country, and shape for UFO sigtings. The user can enter specifc values for these fields and the results will show in the dynamic table on the right side along with information such as the duration of the sighting and any comments.

## Summary

A drawback to this search design is that the input fields are case sensitive so typing in FL for Florida in the state field will not yield any results in the table. In the future, providing a button at the bottom of the search to clear the input will be usueful. While clicking "UFO Sightings" at the top left corner of the page refreshes the page and clears the search fields, it is not intuitive for the user and may be tedious to delete the criteria they had entered. Introducing a drop down list for some of the search fileds will also enhance the user's experience. This is because fields such as "state" do not have values for all 50 states, so it makes sense to provide a drop-down list of states where there were UFO sightings for the user to select from.
